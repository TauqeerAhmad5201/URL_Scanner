# URL Scanner
This was a very simple URL Scanner that used Google Safe Browsing API to check if the link was safe to open or if it was malicious. I used the help of Google Developer Docs and ChatGPT to build this project and learned with it as well.

## Prerequisites 
- Python 3. X

## How to Use it
- First, clone the repository
  '''bash
    git clone https://github.com/xAffix/URL_Scanner.git
- Navigate to Repository
  cd URL_Scanner
- Run the command
  '''bash
    python3 app.py
- Open the localhost on port 5000
- Put the URL and Check if it's safe or not
